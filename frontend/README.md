# ⚡ Big O Energy

> Studying like an algo. Documenting like a dev. Sharing like a friend.

## 🧠 What is this?

**Big O Energy** is my public roadmap to becoming a top-tier engineer, with my eyes set on elite firms like **Jane Street**, **Jump Trading**, **HRT**, **Google**, and **Meta**.

I'm learning, building, and teaching **everything** I’d want to know if I were six months behind myself: from systems design and distributed systems to data structures, algorithms, and quant brain-melters.

This repo is my basecamp — a digital gym where I train for technical interviews, read iconic papers, build nerdy tools, and drop knowledge to help others do the same.

---

## 💼 Why am I doing this?

I want to work at one of the hardest, smartest, and most selective companies in tech or trading — and I want to bring people along for the ride.

- To **sharpen my own thinking** by writing, teaching, and building.
- To **prove my edge** through original projects, reflections, and code.
- To **help others** who feel lost in the prep-game noise by giving them clarity, strategy, and 🔥 explanations.

Big O Energy is a signal — not just that I know my runtime complexity, but that I'm bringing **max effort**, **clean execution**, and **relentless curiosity** to everything I touch.

## 🧩 What's inside?

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/interviews/` | Structured notes + code for DSA, quant prep, and systems design |
| `/papers/` | My breakdowns of classic CS and trading papers (e.g. Google Search, CAP theorem, etc.) |
| `/projects/` | Original builds to show my learning in action (search engine sim, order book, LRU cache, etc.) |
| `/streams/` | Highlights + scripts from live sessions explaining concepts or solving problems |
| `/coaching/` | Playbooks, frameworks, and templates for tech interview prep (coming soon) |

---

## 🔍 Who is this for?

- Engineers aiming for top-tier roles in **tech** or **trading**
- People tired of generic Leetcode grind and looking for **clarity and context**
- Curious learners who want to build *actual intuition* behind what they’re coding

---

## 🧨 What makes this different?

- I don’t just solve problems — I **show you how I think**
- I don’t hoard progress — I **build in public**
- I don’t pretend to be perfect — I **fail in front of you** and get better each week

If I get the offer, you’ll see **how I did it**.

If I don’t, you’ll still learn **everything I learned** on the way.

## 📅 What’s coming?

- [ ] My own trading systems simulator
- [ ] A "Google Paper" YouTube breakdown series
- [ ] A study group format based on *Big O Energy*
- [ ] Quant prep kits by topic: Graphs, DP, Puzzles, etc.
- [ ] A podcast for deep dives w/ real quant and SWE engineers
